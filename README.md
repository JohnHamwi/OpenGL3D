<!-- INTRODUCTION: Brief introduction about the project, its inspiration, and purpose -->
## Introduction
OpenGL3D is a C++ project that provides a hands-on experience with real-time 3D rendering using OpenGL. Itâ€™s designed to demonstrate the integration of textures, Phong lighting, and interactive camera controls for an immersive graphical environment.

<!-- DESCRIPTION: Detailed description of the project, its features, and functionalities -->
## Description
OpenGL3D showcases the following features:
- Real-time 3D rendering with texture support.
- Phong lighting model for realistic shading effects.
- Interactive camera controls to explore the 3D scene.
- Sample objects with textures to demonstrate the graphics capabilities.
